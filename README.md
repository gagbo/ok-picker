# Ok Picker

A toy application to test egui programming. This application will be a color
picker based on the [Okhsv](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/colorpicker)
colorspace by Bj√∂rn Ottosson, with:

- A 2D picker in the SV space,
- A 1D picker in the Hue space,
- Buttons to increment/decrement any single value of the HSV triple,

And as stretch goals:
- Buttons to add/remove colors to a palette,
- Contrast between each color of the palette and a chosen background color,
- A palette generator that auto-picks colours starting from 1 or 2 colors and a
  set of rules:
  + Just the foreground color
  + A foreground and a background color
  + A foreground and an accent color
